/**
 * In TheilSen Regression, the estimation of the model is done by calculating the slopes and intercepts of a subpopulation of all possible combinations of p subsample points.<br>
 * If an intercept is fitted, p must be greater than or equal to n_features + 1.<br>
 * The final slope and intercept is then defined as the spatial median of these slopes and intercepts.<br>
 * The TheilSen Regression model can be represented using the below equation:<br>
 * <br>
 * <b style="font: italic bold 24px courier;">y = a<sub>0</sub> + a<sub>1</sub>x</b><br>
 * <br>
 * where<br>
 * <ul>
 * <li><b style="font: italic bold 24px courier;">a<sub>0</sub></b> is the intercept of the Regression line (can be obtained putting x=0)
 * <li><b style="font: italic bold 24px courier;">a<sub>1</sub></b> is the slope of the regression line, which tells whether the line is increasing or decreasing
 * </ul>
 * <br>
 * See details on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theil%E2%80%93Sen_estimator">Theilâ€“Sen estimator</a>.
