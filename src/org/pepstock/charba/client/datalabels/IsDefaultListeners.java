/**
 * This is the LISTENER options of {@link DataLabelsPlugin#ID} plugin allows to register callback(s) to be notified when an event is detected on a specific label. This option is an
 * object where the property is the type of the event to listen and the value is a callback with a unique context argument.<br>
 * Charba events need to be enabled in order to get the associated label event working.<br>
 * If no listener is registered, incoming events are immediately ignored, preventing extra computation such as intersecting label bounding box. That means there should be no
 * performance penalty for configurations that don't use events.
